See **[nshea3.github.io](https://nshea3.github.io)** [^1].

I am a data scientist and engineer with BlueConduit, where I work to secure a clean water future $\forall$.

I am interested in spatial statistics, simulation, interpretable ML, and Bayesian methods, especially applications in natural resources, social science, and financial markets.
